# Giftastic-API-Fun

Here is a gif search page that utilizes GIPHY's API to pull gifs and show them to the user. The theme for the page is movies (titles, actors, characters, etc.). You can click on any of the premade buttons in the top section of the page and see those related gifs. You can also enter your own text in the "Create Your Own Button" section and create a new search button in the top section. As mentioned, the theme for the page is movies, but honestly it will pull any gifs from GIPHY if you creat a new button for a search. Have fun and check out some sweet gifs. :)

In this project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, and AJAX to query the Giphy API.
